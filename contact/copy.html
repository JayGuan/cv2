          <p class="detail">At age of 16, Jay started his first job as a busboy at Wild Ginger Restaurant. He quickly picked up English language and became friends with employees and customers. He consistently worked an average of 12-15 hours per week through high school and college. At his 21st birthday, a regular customer purchased a bottle of wine in recognition of his excellent service.  In his first year of college, Jay applied over 10 companies at his university career fair. Unfortunately, he was not able to proceed further with those opportunities.  However, he did not give up. His persistency and hard work helped him to land his first internship as a freshman. Jay enjoyed talking to customers and solving software/hardware issues during the internship. During his second year of college, Jay co-founded VCU Cyber Security Club and became a member of ACM club and Linux User Group. Jay’s desire of learning and adapting new things/technologies helped him succeed. During the summer of 2016, he interned at GE healthcare and worked on multiple side projects which enhanced his leadership and teamwork skills. He is looking forward to obtaining a part time software development & information security position during school semesters.
